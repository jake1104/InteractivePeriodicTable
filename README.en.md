## Interactive Periodic Table

[kor](README.md)

## Overview

This site is a web interactive tool designed for **customizing** the Periodic Table of Elements.

## Key Features

### 1. Periodic Table Data

  * **Element Data:** Based on a data set that includes the atomic number, symbol, English/Korean names, atomic weight, category, and state at standard temperature and pressure (STP) for each element.

### 2. Layout Editor

An editor is provided to modify the properties of each item using the Hydrogen (H) element as an example.

  * **Position Editing:** Internal items within the element block (Atomic Number, Symbol, Names, Atomic Weight, State Marker) can be easily dragged and moved to change their exact position within the element block.
  * **Property Editing:** You can edit the font size, color, **Bold**/*Italic* style, and font for each item. Visibility can also be selected.
  * **Multi-Selection:** Multiple items can be simultaneously selected by pressing Ctrl to change their styles all at once.

### 3. Display and Color Design

  * **State Marker:** You can change the symbol ('G', 'L', 'S', '?') and the corresponding text color used to indicate the element's state (Gas, Liquid, Solid, Unknown) at STP.
  * **Category Colors:** You can directly set the background color for all element categories (Alkali Metal, Transition Metal, Metalloid, etc.) or toggle the category coloring off entirely.

### 4. Export

You can export the Periodic Table design edited using the methods above.

  * **Supported Formats:** PNG image, JPEG image, PDF document
